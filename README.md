# tig-tac-toe-minmax
This program allows the user to play tic tac toe (aka noughts and crosses) on the command line against the computer.
The computer is playing optimally (at least I hope it is), using the Minimax algorithm.
The program is written entirely in python, using only the python standard library, and as such should be 100% cross platform.
License information is at the top of "main.py".

Note: I have not yet implemented the alpha-beta pruning optimisation (which is one of the most common ways of improving minimax).
